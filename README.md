# SQLumAI
SQLumAI is an invisible, AI-powered proxy for Microsoft SQL Server.  
It forwards all queries without delay, while capturing snapshots of requests and responses.  
These snapshots are analyzed by a local LLM to uncover missing data, detect format issues,  
highlight process gaps, and generate actionable insights â€“ without ever blocking traffic.
