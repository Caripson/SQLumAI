# Archived scripts

The scripts in this folder are not part of the primary developer workflow and have zero or low references in the codebase. They are kept for reference and can be restored if needed.

- drift_utils.py: Utilities for computing simple null-ratio drift between snapshots.
- publish_feedback.py: Post latest daily report to a webhook; falls back to writing a JSON payload under `outbox/`.
